# SE-Mod-ADP-Reworked
This mod is a rework of Automatic Driller Platform (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=758796524).

The reworked version can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1091728522.

It adds texture compatibility with DirectX 11 and reworks some of the mechanics in the original mod, including Gravel/Stone production ratios.

# Development
This mod makes use of Space Engineers' APIs. 

To let Visual Studio resolve these dependencies, add `Sandbox*.dll` and `VRage*.dll` in Space Engineers' `Bin64` directory as dependencies to the project.
